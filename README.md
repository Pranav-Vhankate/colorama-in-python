# colorama-in-python
Using 'colorama' to print colored text in python
Installing: 
```pip installing colorama```

Note:
The output of the .ipynb(Jupyter notebook) files does not print the colored text but if you run the files in your notebook, it will!
Screenshots are also there to see how my output looks after executing the code!
